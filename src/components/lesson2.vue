            <p><span class="pl-9">Have</span> you ever wondered how you able to see things in this world with your eyes? Our ability to see through our eyes depends on the reflective properties of light. Without reflection, we would only be able to see luminous objects like the sun, light bulbs, and computer screens.</p>
            <p><span class="pl-9">The</span> old Greek mathematician Euclid depicted the law of reflection in around 300 BCE. This expresses that the light goes in straight lines and reflects from a surface at a similar edge at which it hit it. Euclid said that the light travels in rays that are discrete, like atoms, not continuous, like waves. Reflection of light happens when the waves experience a surface or other limit that does not retain the vitality of the radiation and bounces the waves from the surface. The approaching light wave is alluded as an incident wave, and the wave that is bounces from the surface is named reflected wave.</p>
            <p><span class="pl-9">B.</span> Aronov et. al. was presented the concept of the polygon visible by considering the two types of reflection which is the specular and the diffuse where they show the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Specular reflection is one of the main types of reflection which is described as a mirror-like reflection of light from the surface. Meanwhile, the diffuse reflection of light or other waves or particles from a surface such that a ray incident on the surface is scattered at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection.</p>
            <p><span class="pl-9">To</span> have a further understanding about the difference between specular reflection and diffuse reflection let us perform an experiment. There is a lot of laboratory experiment that you can do to explain any types of reflection of lights. That is why the material of this experiment can only be found inside the house. Also, this is easy to perform because it is designed by “DIY” or “Do It Yourself”.</p>

          <p class="text-lg sm:text-base"><span class="pl-9">When</span> a ray of light approaches a smooth polished surface and the light ray bounces back, it is called the reflection of light. The incident light ray which lands upon the surface is said to be reflected off the surface. The ray that bounces back is called the reflected ray. Reflection of light law states that; the angle of reflection and incident ray are congruent to each other and it both lies in the same plane.</p>

          <p class="text-lg sm:text-base"><span class="pl-9 font-bold text-xl">Specular reflection</span> refers to a clear and sharp reflection like the ones you get in a mirror. This reflective surface reflects almost all the light incident on it uniformly. There is not much variation in the angles of reflections between various points. This means that the haziness and the blurring are almost eliminated.<br/>Meanwhile,</p>
          <p class="text-lg sm:text-base"><span class="pl-9 font-bold text-xl">Diffuse reflection</span> is the reflection that is observed in a rough surface these often happen when the material or object has a rough texture or sometimes due to a disturbance. In this experiment, the difference between the specular and diffuse reflection was shown and this aims to understand the significant difference between these two types of experiments.</p>
